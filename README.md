Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN Transfer Learning
This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with transfer learning. Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as the starting point for a new model, allowing us to leverage the knowledge learned from a large dataset to solve a different but related problem.

Dataset
For this project, we will utilize a dataset of brain MRI images containing both tumor and non-tumor samples. You can obtain such datasets from medical imaging repositories like Kaggle, or from research institutions.
Requirements
Python
TensorFlow (for implementing CNN)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Scikit-learn (for metrics evaluation)
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset.
Preprocess the images (resize, normalize, etc.).
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
2. Transfer Learning
Choose a pre-trained CNN model like VGG, ResNet, or Inception.
Modify the top layers of the pre-trained model to match the number of classes in your dataset.
Freeze the pre-trained layers to prevent them from being updated during training.
Conclusion
In this project, we successfully implemented brain tumor detection using CNN with transfer learning. We achieved promising results in detecting brain tumors from MRI images, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in medical image analysis tasks. Further improvements could be made by experimenting with different architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques. Additionally, deploying the model for real-world use could have significant implications in assisting medical professionals in diagnosing brain tumors accurately and efficiently.
